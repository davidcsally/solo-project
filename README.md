My first React App! This is a little web scraper that collects top song information form Spotify, and displays it to a chart I built in React. Basically a clone of this: https://spotifycharts.com/regional

## Commands
  start: ``npm start``
  test: ``npm test``

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
